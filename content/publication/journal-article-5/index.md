abstract: Serum antigens were captured from a cohort consisting of 60 RA patients (45 ACPA-positive RA patients and 15 ACPA-negative RA patients), together with sex- and age-matched 30 osteoarthritis (OA) patients and 30 healthy controls. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was then performed. The significantly upregulated and downregulated proteins with fold change > 1.5 (p < 0.05) were selected. Based on these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), a machine learning model was trained and validated to classify RA, ACPA-positive RA, and ACPA-negative RA. We identified 62, 71, and 49 DEPs in RA, ACPA-positive RA, and ACPA-negative RA, respectively, as compared to OA and healthy controls. Typical pathway enrichment and protein–protein interaction networks were shown among these DEPs. Three panels were constructed to classify RA, ACPA-positive RA, and ACPA-negative RA using random forest models algorithm based on the molecular signature of DEPs, whose area under curve (AUC) were calculated as 0.9949 (95% CI = 0.9792–1), 0.9913 (95% CI = 0.9653–1), and 1.0 (95% CI = 1–1). This study illustrated the serum auto-antigen profiling of RA. Among them, three panels of antigens were identified as diagnostic biomarkers to classify RA, ACPA-positive, and ACPA-negative RA patients.
