I’m a postdoc at Columbia University in the [Shen Lab](http://www.columbia.edu/~ys2411), focusing on computational biology and human genetics. Currently, my work centers on predicting the selection coefficients of missense mutations using state-of-the-art deep learning models. I developed [SeqDance and ESMDance](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.11.617911v2), two protein language models trained on protein dynamics data, and demonstrated the scaling performance of ESM2 on [mutation effect prediction](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.25.650688v1).  
I earned my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Peking University in the [Li Lab](http://bioinfolilab.phasep.pro/), where I built computational tools for studying [phase separation](http://lab.phasep.pro/) and [protein degradation](http://degron.phasep.pro/).  
I was born in Zhucheng, China, and I enjoy basketball, photography, and skiing.
