I’m a postdoc at Columbia University, working with [Dr. Yufeng Shen](http://www.columbia.edu/~ys2411) to study computational biology and human genetics. My research focuses on protein dynamics and multi-conformation through deep learning, and how mutations influence protein behavior. I earned my PhD in Bioinformatics from Peking University, where I developed computational tools to investigate [phase separation](http://lab.phasep.pro/) and [protein degradation](http://degron.phasep.pro/) with [Dr. Tingting Li](http://bioinfolilab.phasep.pro/).  
I was born in Zhucheng, Shandong, China, and enjoy basketball, photography, and skiing.
