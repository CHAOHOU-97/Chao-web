I have developed three bioinformatics tools for studying phase separation:
PhaSepDB: A novel database that provides a curated collection of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) proteins and proteins located in membraneless organelles (MLOs).  
MloDisDB: A curated database detailing the relationships between membraneless organelles and diseases.  
PhaSePred: A meta-predictor for phase-separating proteins, distinguishing LLPS proteins as self-assembling or partner-dependent. It integrates results from tools like catGRANULE, PScore, PLAAC, ESpritz, SEG, CIDER, DeepCoil, and DeepPhase.  
Additionally, I designed experiments to investigate the phase separation properties of chromatin-associated proteins using gradient elution with 1,6-hexanediol.
