I've developped three bioinformatics tools for studying phase separation:
PhaSepDB is a novel database that provides a collection of manually curated liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) proteins and Membraneless organelles (MLOs) located proteins.
MloDisDB is a manually curated dataBase of the relations between membraneLess organelles and diseases
PhaSePred is A Meta-predictor For Phase-Separating Proteins. We define and predict the LLPS proteins as self-assemble and partner-dependent, the results from catGRANULE, PScore, PLAAC, ESpritz, SEG, CIDER, DeepCoil, DeepPhase were integrated as well.

I also designed experiments to investigate phase separation properties of chromatin-associated proteins using gradient elution of 1,6-hexanediol.
